Since there is a chance I will need to turn this project more than once, I've decided to just put all the game instructions in the same place. 


Really simple game. 

- Use the arrow keys to move the player.

- There are two level. Flames and StarLord.

- You need to collect all the three keys in order to move on to the next level.

- Each level has two startup characters and one dynamically generated characters. The dynamically character is generated when you collect all the keys. 
	* Please refer to the README to check the conditions and actions for each character.
	
- You have to collect three keys on each level in order to move on to the next level. 

- If a player hits you, you will lose some of your money (either percentage or set amount).

- If a enemy hits you, you will respawn at a random location of the board, on where you began the game. If you get cornered, you will lose all you money and the game will end.  

The enemy breakdown is as follows. 

** Please refer to the README to get a better understanding of all the sequences and the associated conditions and actions.
