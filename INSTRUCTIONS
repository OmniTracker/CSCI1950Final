Debugger: 
----------------------
- Raycasting works for AAB Shapes and Polygon.   
- I can't move the polygon in the corner because I never got the polygon collision working. 
  That wasn't a primary requirement, so I just didn't do it. 
- You are still able to shoot the raycast onto the polygon in the corner.
